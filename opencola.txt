Soft Drink Formula

Version 1.1.3

Disclaimer:

Making soft drinks is not for the faint of heart, nor the dirty of finger. It is a solemn enterprise not to be entered into 

lightly, as with marriage or buying used farm machinery.

With any food-prep, failure to observe basic hygienic principles, follow directions, and exercise common sense can 

have grave consequences. OpenCola assumes no liability for any problems that arise out of the use of this 

document. Proceed at your own risk. No one's putting a gun to your head, so don't bother if you can't boil water.

Improper use of cola might result in blunt trauma, puncture wounds, physical illness, mental illness, caffeine 

dependency, dental necrosis, acid reflux, death, devastation, and random tax audits. Or it might not.

A list of warnings has been provided below. We did not include them for our health – we included them for yours. 

Read them. Know them. Follow them. Tattoo them to your backside.

Just in case you have any doubt: following the directions below may be hazardous to your health and property. 

You assume any and all risk arising from the manufacture and consumption of cola.

An important note: this is not the recipe for “OpenCola” – that is, the canned beverage from OpenCola that you 

may have received at a trade show, or other venue or outlet. Making canned cola requires millions of dollars in 

abstruse gear and manufacturing gizmos. It's easier to make nerve gas than manufacture cola. This is a kitchensink recipe that you can make all on your own. It is our kitchen-sink recipe. We figured it out somewhere between 

coding the COLA SDK and debugging the Linux build of the clerver.

Anyway, we've tried to be nice about the disclaimer. If it's not good enough for you, here's what our lawyers have 

to say about the whole shootin' match.

By copying and/or distributing the Program, you hereby agree to the following: 

Indemnity: You shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless OpenCola, its affiliates, directors, officers, and 

employees from and against any third-party claim, demand, cause of action, debt, liability, cost or expense 

(including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of your use of the Recipe, or any derivative 

thereof, including, but not limited to, any claims arising from your distribution of soft drink based on the Recipe or 

any derivatives thereof.

International: OpenCola makes no representation that the Recipe, or any soft drink based on the Recipe or any 

derivatives thereof, may be appropriate for use in locations outside of the United States or Canada, and accessing 

them from any location where their use is illegal is prohibited. If you choose to access this Recipe from any 

location outside of the United States or Canada, you do so at your own risk, and are responsible for compliance

with all local laws.

Original text

Introduction:

Contained hereunder is a HOW-TO for brewing up kitchen-sink OpenCola. Amazingly enough, every soft-drink 

vendor we spoke to acted like the preparation of cola was some kind of deep, dark trade-seekrut™ . With much 

reverse-engineering and creative shopping, the research kitchens at OpenCola have coopered together the 

following makefile for brewing up The Black Waters of Corporate Imperialism™ in the privacy of your own home.

The basis for the whole thing is the 7X, Top-Seekrut™ formula. Our sources tell us that 7X is the internal CocaCola codename for their syrup. You'll note that the 7X formula contains eight ingredients: still more evidence of the 

deviousness of the Soda Gnomes.

As it turns out, mixing up a batch of cola's pretty easy. Finding the ingredients is damned hard. Most of this file is 

about finding and handling ingredients so as to produce a tasty bevvy without blowing up your kitchen, melting 

your flesh off your bones, or poisoning yourself. As with all undertakings of great moment, read and understand the 

instructions before attempting to commit cola on your own. Pay special attention to the "Warnings" section.

This recipe is licensed under the GNU General Public license. It is "Open Source" Cola, or, if you prefer, "Free" 

Cola. That means you're free to use this recipe to make your own cola, or to make derivative colas. If you distribute 

derivative colas, you're expected to send email to the recipe's author, Amanda Foubister (amanda@opencola.com) 

with your updates. In the future, we expect to have a CVS server up to handle additions, bug-reports, etc.

The Formula

7X (Top Seekrut™ ) flavoring formula:

3.50 ml orange oil

1.00 ml lemon oil

1.00 ml nutmeg oil

1.25 ml cassia oil

0.25 ml coriander oil

0.25 ml neroli oil2.75 ml lime oil

0.25 ml lavender oil

10.0 g gum arabic

3.00 ml water

OpenCola syrup:

2.00 tsp. 7X formula

3.50 tsp. 75% phosphoric acid or citric acid

2.28 l water

2.36 kg plain granulated white table sugar

0.50 tsp. caffeine (optional)

30.0 ml caramel color

Preparation

7X Flavoring:

Mix oils together in a cup. Add gum arabic, mix with a spoon. Add water and mix well. I used my trusty Braun mixer 

for this step, mixing for 4-5 minutes. You can also transfer to a blender for this step. Can be kept in a sealed glass 

jar in the fridge or at room temperature.

Please note that this mixture will separate. The Gum Arabic is essential to this part of the recipe, as you are mixing 

oil and water.

Syrup:

In a one gallon container (I used the Rubbermaid Servin' Saver Dry Food Keeper, 1.3 US Gal/4.92 l), take 5 mls of 

the 7X formula, add the 75% phosphoric or citric acid. Add the water, then the sugar. While mixing, add the 

caffeine, if desired. Make sure the caffeine is completely dissolved. Then add the caramel color. Mix thoroughly.

Cola:

To finish drink, take one part syrup and add 5 parts carbonated water.

Scavenging and Handling Ingredients

7X flavor:

Measurement: I used a dropper purchased at a Shoppers Drug Mart (normally used to measure infant portions of 

medicine, I believe).

Oils: Oils can cause skin irritation. Wear latex food-prep or surgical gloves. If oils come in contact with skin, wash 

with soap and water.

I purchased all oils from health food stores and the herbalist store, Thuna's (see notes on gum arabic).

Everything could have come from the herbalist's. Try for 100 percent pure, undiluted oils. I used oils from the 

following companies:

? CK Solutions, Ft. Wayne, IN 46825 

? Aura Cacia Oils, Weaverville, CA 96093 ? Aromaforce Essential Oils 

? Frontier Natural Flavors, www.frontiercoop.com

? Karooch, Peterborough, ONT K9J 7Y8 

When I purchased the oils, I specifically asked whether they were food grade or not. All persons said that they 

were, one person said she used them internally all the time.

Neroli is a very expensive item, be prepared (US$48.52 for 5.00 ml).

All others were a more reasonable price (US$2-9.30).

Gum Arabic: It is very important that you get only food-grade Gum Arabic. There is also an art-grade, which is 

readily available at art supply stores – never use art-grade Gum Arabic! Art-grade Gum Arabic is toxic. It will 

make you ill. You'll be sad. We'll be sad.

I found food-grade Gum Arabic at an herbalist store in Toronto called Thuna's (416) 461-8191. I purchased 112g 

for US$12.46, which will make more than 11 batches of flavoring formula.

Syrup:

Water: good old tap water will do, if you trust your tap. I used spring water.

75% Phosphoric Acid: Due to its acidity, this product is corrosive to the eyes and skin. Handle with gloved hands, 

and use extreme caution. If comes in contact with the eyes or skin, immediately flush with plenty of water for at 

least 15 minutes. Get medical attention. Rinse any spills on clothing or other surfaces thoroughly. Store in a secure 

area. Do not store more than 50.0 ml.

Try finding phosphoric acid at a compounding pharmacy in your area. There are pharmacies that still mix their own 

individual compounds and still stock phosphoric acid.

Citric acid: Very easy to find. I found mine at a Shoppers Drug Mart (Rougier Pharma Inc, Quebec, Canada J7J 

1P3). Says right on the label, "For the preparation of acidulous drinks and effervescing draughts, and preservation 

of jams and jellies." According to the Coke history book, citric acid was used first in the formula, but they now use 

the phosphoric.

Sugar: Basic granulated white table sugar found everywhere. Buy from a bulk store to save some money.

Caffeine: It's best not to store caffeine in any amount. Caffeine can kill people in relatively small doses. The 

median lethal dose for an adult human is around 10 grams, or approximately one third of an ounce. You can find 

out more by reading the Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) for caffeine at 

http://www.jtbaker.com/msds/c0165.htm. Don't yeild to the temptation to create a "Super-Jolt™ ," adding tons and 

tons of the white stuff to your cola, our you'll be in a world of hurt. If stored, store in a secure area away from 

children. Toxic by inhalation and ingestion: If inhaled, remove to fresh air, If ingested, call a physician. Possible 

teratogen and mutagen. If product comes in contact with the eyes, flush with plenty of water. There is some great 

information on caffeine and it's over-consumption at http://www.thecaffeinepage.com.

Caffeine is completely optional. I used part of a caffeine pill (MVP, www.mvpnutrition.com), ground up in a pestle 

with a mortar. According to information on the pill bottle and on the Web site, the pills are 100% caffeine. As an 

extra safety precaution, I strained all of the syrup through a 4-ply of cheesecloth, in case any of the caffeine wasn't 

dissolved.

Caramel color: I found mine at a bakery supply store (World of Cake Decorating, 1766 Weston Road, Toronto, 

Ontario, Canada 416-247-4935). I was originally told to use double strength caramel color, but couldn't find it 

anywhere (retail or wholesale). It really only adds color, so it makes it a bit paler than we are used to coming out of 

a can or bottle. No other difference that we could discern during our taste-testing.

Cola:Soda Water: I purchased a soda charger and CO2 cartridges at Nikolaou's (629 Queen Street West, Toronto, 

Ontario, Canada 416-504-6411) to deliver the soda charge needed to make the cola fizzy. At testing, no one was 

impressed. What worked best was adding canned sodium-free (very important!) soda water to the syrup.

If you would like to make soda water yourself as well, here is a recipe from a great Web site on beverages 

(http://www.upl.cs.wisc.edu/~craft/bar/section7.html):

Soda: Carbonated Water

? 5 U.S. gallons of water 

? 1.5 cups sugar (or sugar syrup) 

? 1 teaspoon dry bread yeast (rehydrated) 

I fill each bottle 2/3 full, screw on the top, and leave for one or two weeks. Each weekend I measure and add the 

syrup to a few bottles, top them off with water and stick them in the fridge.

This is a very quick operation. I had experimented with adding dry sugar, but this caused an excessive amount of 

foaming.

Warnings:

These are all associated with each of their ingredients, but they're repeated here just to make sure. We're not 

making this stuff up. Cola is a harsh mistress, and she is quick to anger. Heed the warnings below or proceed into 

certain peril.

Oils: Can cause skin irritation. If oils come in contact with skin, wash with soap and water.

Gum Arabic: It is very important that you get only food-grade Gum Arabic. There is also an art-grade, which is 

readily available at art supply stores – never use art-grade Gum Arabic! Art grade Gum Arabic is toxic. It will 

make you ill. You'll be sad. We'll be sad.

75% Phosphoric Acid: Due to its acidity, this product is corrosive to the eyes and skin. Handle with gloved hands, 

and use extreme caution. If comes in contact with the eyes or skin, immediately flush with plenty of water for at 

least 15 minutes. Get medical attention. Rinse any spills on clothing or other surfaces thoroughly. Store in a secure 

area. Do not store more than 50.0 ml.

Caffeine: It's best not to store caffeine in any amount. Caffeine can kill people in relatively small doses. The 

median lethal dose for an adult human is around 10 grams, or approximately one third of an ounce. You can find 

out more by reading the Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) for caffeine at 

http://www.jtbaker.com/msds/c0165.htm. Don't yield to the temptation to create a “Super-Jolt™ ” adding tons and 

tons of the white stuff to you cola, our you'll be in a world of hurt. If stored, store in a secure area away from 

children. Toxic by inhalation and ingestion: If inhaled, remove to fresh air. If ingested, call a physician. Possible 

teratogen and mutagen. If product comes in contact with the eyes, flush with plenty of water. There is some great 

information on caffeine and it's over-consumption at http://www.thecaffeinepage.com.

The 7X that I experimented with comes from the great Coke history book, For God, Country, & Coca-Cola, by Mark 

Pendergrast, Basic Books, 1993, 2000, ISBN 0-465-05468-4. I know, I know. I list 8 oils, not 7. It notes in the book 

that many believe lavender to be part of the 7X formula, so I tried it. We liked it in testing.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not 

allowed.

Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the 

GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software–to make 

sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software 

Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software 

Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your 

programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed 

to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you 

wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it 

in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to 

surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the 

software, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all 

the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must 

show them these terms so they know their rights.

We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you 

legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.

Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no 

warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients 

to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the 

original authors' reputations.

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that 

redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To 

prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, 

DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

1. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder 

saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers 

to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any 

derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either 

verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is 

included without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you". 

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are 

outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is 

covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made 

by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

2. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any 

medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate 

copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the 

absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with 

the Program. 

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer 

warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

3. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on 

the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, 

provided that you also meet all of these conditions: 

a. You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files 

and the date of any change. 

b. You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is 

derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third 

parties under the terms of this License. 

c. If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, 

when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an 

announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty 

(or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under 

these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the 

Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work 

based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.) 

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not 

derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in 

themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as 

separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on 

the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for 

other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; 

rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based 

on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a 

work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other 

work under the scope of this License.

4. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or 

executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the 

following: a. Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be 

distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for 

software interchange; or, 

b. Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a 

charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete 

machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of 

Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, 

c. Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding

source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you 

received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with 

Subsection b above.) 

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an 

executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any 

associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the 

executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that 

is normally distributed (in either source o binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and 

so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies 

the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, 

then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the 

source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

5. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this 

License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will 

automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or 

rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain 

in full compliance. 

6. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants 

you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited 

by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work 

based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and 

conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it. 

7. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically 

receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these 

terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights 

granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License. 

8. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not 

limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or 

otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of 

this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License 

and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For 

example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who 

receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this 

License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program. 

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the 

balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other 

circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or 

to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the 

free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have 

made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on 

consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to 

distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this 

License.

9. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by 

copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted 

only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if 

written in the body of this License. 

10. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License 

from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail 

to address new problems or concerns. 

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this 

License which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and 

conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the 

Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published 

by the Free Software Foundation.

11. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are 

different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free 

Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. 

Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free 

software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally. 

NO WARRANTY

11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE 

PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE 

STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE 

PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, 

INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND 

FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND 

PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, 

YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 

12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY 

COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE 

PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY 

GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE 

OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR 

DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR 

A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH 

HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
